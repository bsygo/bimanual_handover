Training:
- Increase/Delete max_steps. With the effort feedback, it might be possible to run until contacts were made. Sometimes grasp attempts look promising but get terminated by max_steps to early.

- Increase effort threshold/Individual thresholds. Some fingers and rewards look like they might reach the threshold while not actually making contact. Would need to get investigated.

- Increase force threshold. Not very important, bu some book lifts get accepted even though they look like they shouldn't.

- Adjust hand position for book. A little offset on the y-axis may let the fingers make contact earlier and better.


Effort model:
- The fully trained model was very bad for both book and can. While it closed the fingers, it was very slow and didn't even managed to come close to making contact in time.

- The model at step 5400 was much better. While it performed similarly, maybe a bit better, for the book, it managed to grasp the can as the previously best model.

- One explanation might be, that the second day training seemed very different, so maybe model was not correctly loaded.

- Objects seemed to vary enough to not overfit to one object.

- Average reward dropped extremely around second training.

- Losses plateau relatively quickly. -> More training doesn't seem helpful.

-> Try again with training changes?
